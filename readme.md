# normalize-uri

**Stability: Legacy**.
This package is no longer recommended for use.
It’s still covered by semantic-versioning guarantees and not yet deprecated,
but use of this package should be avoided.
Please use [`micromark-util-sanitize-uri`][micromark-util-sanitize-uri], which
is a much better way to solve the same problems.

Legacy [documentation for this
package](https://github.com/wooorm/normalize-uri/tree/eb1d0d6)
is still available in Git.
